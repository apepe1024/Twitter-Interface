Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project 7: Twitter Interface by Alessandro Pepe

This app requires the use of your own config.js file in the root folder.
Template as follows:

`module.exports = {
  consumer_key:         '...',
  consumer_secret:      '...',
  access_token:         '...',
  access_token_secret:  '...',
  timeout_ms:           60*1000  // optional HTTP request timeout to apply to all requests.
};`

Update upon project review:

Could not figure out how to submit tweet without refresh, and could not figure out how to place user background image as banner. NO LONGER going for Exceeds Expectations goals.

Implemented Moment package for use in formatting dates to human readable status.
